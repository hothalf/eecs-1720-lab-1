# autonomous-artistic-agent

code templates, hints, examples, and general content for our artistic bots

Your critial perspective is important in this project - [read me](https://matita.github.io/min-gh-jekyll/link/how-to-think-about-bots-data-society-points-medium)

>> To get a better grip on the questions that bots raise, Sam Woolley, a researcher at the Data & Society institute, organized a workshop that brought together a diverse group of bot experts. This article is the output of the event, a tour of the bot and its semi-autonomy from three perspectives: that of the designer, the implementer, and the regulator. In each, the bot presents unique challenges that have yet to be fully reckoned with by any human.

## Updates

### videos

video from Lab session will be available on eClass 
- have to make a new one.. didn't have lab sessions on auto record
- ...

### bot

.. has been reactivated!
twitter said was a mistake -- so use the code as is but I will add a limit to the images shortly
- code edit done
- screencap shows the posted image

## What to do next

For the initial Lab Exercise portion of Lab Project 2 you have been asked to:

1. Consider the description of the project
   - are you interested in generating content?
   - filtering content?
   - text? 
   - sound?
   - image?
   - do you want followers?
   - to grab data?
2. Think about:
   - do you want to interact directly with others?
   - act as a publishing platform?
   - share to an audience?
3. Using these prompts and others from the project description:
   - research various APIs that exist
   - try to find APIs beyond the standard / big names if that makes sense. Why?
     - they might be easier to work with than those highly public platforms or
     - have simpler interfaces or
     - have more flexibility
   - consider the type of media and type of interaction you find suitable for your theme or role
     - what APIs fit this?
4. Select three APIs
5. Assemble a list or short summary of:
   - the authentification process
   - authentication tokens/keys
   - are there specific functions to know?
   - how many tokens? what are they named?
   - can you link a resource to verify a use case
     - quickly?
     - easily?

Something to consider: "when we are working on the code live during a lecture - what information regarding auth would you need so that you don't have to go looking for it while we are doing the examples"
